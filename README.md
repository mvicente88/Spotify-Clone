# Spotify Clone with Angular

This project is a Spotify simulation and clone developed using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0. It aims to replicate the core functionalities of the Spotify music streaming service, including searching and playing songs, managing playlists, exploring artists and albums, and personalized recommendations. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Access to the tracks page

If you go to the login page `http://localhost:4200/auth/login` these are the login credentials:
    email: test@test.com
    password: 123456789

You will then be redirected to `http://localhost:4200/tracks`.

## Features

Song search and playback.
Playlist creation and management.
Artist and album exploration.
Personalized recommendations.
User account integration.

## Future Plans

### Unit Testing with Karma
We're actively working on incorporating unit testing using Karma. Unit tests help ensure that individual components and functions of the application behave as expected. We'll be writing test cases to validate the behavior of various Angular components, services, directives, and pipes.

Run `ng test` to check the unit testing

### End-to-End Testing
In addition to unit testing, we plan to implement end-to-end (E2E) testing. E2E tests simulate real user scenarios and interactions within the application. We'll be using tools like Protractor to automate the testing process and ensure the smooth functioning of the entire application flow.

Stay tuned for updates as I make progress on adding these crucial testing aspects to the project!
